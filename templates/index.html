                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <p>To generate an image with specific dimensions, append the following parameters to the URL: <strong>{{ DOMAIN }}</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>w - The width of the image (must be an integer)</li>
                    <li>h - The height of the image (must be an integer)</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>A simple example</h3>
                <p>The URL for an image that has a <strong>height of 500px</strong> and a <strong>width of 500px</strong> would be:</p>
                <pre><code><a href="?h=500&w=500">{{ DOMAIN }}?h=500&w=500</a></code></pre>
                <h3>Adding Text</h3>
                <p>To add text to an image, add the paramter "text". For example:</p>
                <pre><code><a href="?h=500&w=500&text=Hello World!">{{ DOMAIN }}?h=500&w=500&text=Hello World!</a></code></pre>
